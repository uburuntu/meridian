# CLAUDE.md

Project-wide context for any AI coding assistant working on Meridian.
Also see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for cross-tool discovery rules.

## Vision

**Deploy it right. Share it easily.** A strong protocol means nothing if the deployment leaks — an open port, a TLS mismatch, a fingerprint that gives the server away. Meridian ships the strongest available protocol (today: VLESS+Reality) AND configures every layer correctly: firewall, certificates, SNI routing, fingerprinting. One command. Done right.

**Audience:** deployers (self-hosters who want correctness out of the box) + their users (people who scan a QR code and connect).

**Design principles:**
- **Strongest protocol, always** — chase depth, not breadth. No open ports, no TLS leaks, no fingerprinting mistakes.
- **It just works** — every deployment hardened by default. Deployer doesn't need to understand firewall rules, TLS, or SNI.
- **Two-sided UX** — deployer (CLI wizard, smart defaults) AND end-user (PWA connection pages, QR codes, subscription auto-update).
- **Aesthetics are trust** — every surface is UI. CLI output, pages, error messages. In censored regions, polished = safe.

## Architecture (summary)

Python CLI on PyPI. nginx (stream SNI routing + http TLS + reverse proxy) + acme.sh (Let's Encrypt) + Xray (VLESS+Reality) + Remnawave (panel + node + PostgreSQL + Valkey + subscription-page, all pinned). Domain mode adds WSS through Cloudflare CDN. Relay nodes are L4 TCP forwarders (Realm). Declarative `cluster.yml` + `meridian plan / apply` reconcile desired state; optional real-VM harness at `tests/realvm/` for Hetzner-backed integration testing. Website at `getmeridian.org` built with Astro. **Full detail in [website/src/content/docs/en/architecture.md](website/src/content/docs/en/architecture.md).**

## Per-folder CLAUDE.md — the knowledge system

Every folder with distinct architectural concerns has a `CLAUDE.md`. AI assistants load the nearest one before writing code. A pitfall documented here is a bug that never recurs.

**Format (applies to every file, root excepted):**
- Section order: **Design decisions → What's done well → Pitfalls → (optional) Links**
- ≤ 40 lines (leaf files). Root is the spine; longer is acceptable but resist bloat.
- Pitfalls are one-line, concrete, actionable.
- No duplication across files. Root has the big picture; folders have the details. Cross-reference by path.
- No line numbers or function signatures (they drift with code).

**Manifest** — every CLAUDE.md in the tree:

## How to update CLAUDE.md

Updating is part of the change, not a separate task. In the SAME commit:

- **Bug fix** → add a one-line pitfall under the relevant folder's `Pitfalls` section.
- **Design change** → update `Design decisions` of the closest folder. If it changes the big picture, update root Architecture summary + website `architecture.md`.
- **New invariant worth preserving** → add under `What's done well`.
- **Reverted / deprecated** → remove the stale entry. Don't leave historical notes.
- **New folder with distinct concerns** → create a new CLAUDE.md, add it to the Manifest above.

When in doubt: shorter is better. A 30-line CLAUDE.md that's current beats a 100-line one that's half-stale.

## Conventions

- **Shell injection**: `shlex.quote()` on ALL `conn.run()` interpolated values
- **Demo data**: RFC 5737 IPs (`198.51.100.x`), never real server IPs
- **Privacy**: never reference real people's names, server IPs, or domains in commits, code, or docs unless asked
- **Self-hosted everything**: zero external requests (fonts, JS, CSS). Target regions block CDNs
- **Commit per change**: each logical change gets its own commit; include `Refs: uburuntu/meridian#NN` footer when resolving an issue
- **Translations**: use Haiku model agents (`model: "haiku"`) for fast i18n
- **context7 MCP**: check library docs before writing code that depends on external packages

## Community & public communication

**Always ask before posting.** Show the exact text to the user and get approval before any `gh issue`, `gh pr create`, or GitHub comment. This covers issue bodies, PR descriptions, discussion replies, and any `gh` command that creates or modifies public content.

## Development

```bash
make install     # uv sync --extra dev --reinstall-package meridian-vpn
uv run meridian  # always use uv run (not system-wide meridian)
make ci          # lint + format + test + templates
make system-lab  # multi-node Docker lab (~10-15 min)
make real-lab    # optional real-VM on Hetzner (local-only, ~€0.01)
```

## Where things live

- Concrete tracked work → **[GitHub issues](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues)**

## Agent-context imports

The `@path` directives below are a Claude Code convention for pulling in extra files during indexing. Agents that don't support them still find the same content by walking the Manifest above.
