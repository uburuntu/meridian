# Roadmap

Meridian's high-level direction. For concrete trackable tasks see
[open issues](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues). Shipped work is in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

The roadmap is intentionally thematic — specific line items get promoted to
issues as they become well-scoped. Priorities are maintainer calls, not
commitments; contributions in any theme are welcome.

## In flight

**Declarative workflow + real-VM testing** (v4 — shipping now)
Shipped in #28: `cluster.yml` desired state, `meridian plan / apply`,
applied-state tracking, hybrid sync, parallel provisioning, real-VM harness
on Hetzner. Follow-up roadmap issues opened against upstream:

- [#32](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues/32) — multi-hop chain topologies (arbitrary N ≥ 2)
- [#33](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues/33) — multi-IP nodes (ingress IP ≠ egress IP)
- [#34](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues/34) — split routing (direct for selected domains/IPs)
- [#35](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues/35) — end-to-end IPv6 (dual-stack ingress/relay/egress)
- [#36](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues/36) — expand real-VM harness for existing features
- [#37](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/issues/37) — real-VM harness: multi-topology + multi-provider + optional CI smoke

## Near-term themes

### Operator trust and correctness

Meridian's value proposition is correctness — a deployment that does not leak.
Every trust-adjacent gap matters.

- Drift visibility between `cluster.yml` and Remnawave UI edits in every CLI
  path (plan is good; apply should continue catching edge cases)
- Transactional destructive mutations (local + remote + handoff in one
  fail-closed boundary)
- Docs ↔ CLI ↔ command-builder agreement, validated in CI (not just flag tables)
- Recalibrate onboarding promises to the real setup cost (VPS, SSH, mode choice)

### Supply-chain hardening

- Sign and verify install.sh / setup.sh / scanner artifacts; currently the
  install flow trusts a mutable URL
- Pin every remote script or binary that Meridian downloads at runtime
- Move the Remnawave admin UI off the public camouflage identity (or make the
  operator access path explicit, not shared with camouflage)

### Client handoff UX

- Install-aware handoff pages — detect missing target apps, fall back to
  install instructions, keep the import path recoverable
- Trust-first link previews — sender identity in OG/title, not generic
  "Connection Setup"
- Plain-language recipient troubleshooting — remove CLI jargon from user-
  facing recovery docs
- Opinionated recommended app per platform, demote the long list under
  "advanced / other platforms"
- Usable no-JS / failed-config fallback when the handoff page's JavaScript
  or `config.json` fails

### Multi-server fleet ergonomics

- Client migration across servers (`deploy NEW_IP --from OLD_IP`)
- Proactive IP-block detection → webhook / Telegram alerts
- Relay-aware health monitoring across the fleet
- `meridian client disable/enable`, `meridian client list` with usage stats
- Batch `client add`

### Security posture

- Residual IP-cert fingerprinting surface in IP mode — keep tightening
- Probe/check tooling must distinguish IP vs domain cleanly (domain-mode
  cert is intentional, not a leak)
- WARP health-gated and reversible (don't switch outbound until WARP is up)

## Longer horizon (no concrete timeline)

### Branded client app

Fork Hiddify (Flutter + sing-box, Apache 2.0, 28k stars) into a stripped-
down Meridian client optimised for the subscription-URL flow.

### Zero-to-VPN onboarding on the website

In-browser wizard: paste credentials / scan QR / connect. Shares code with
the CLI backend.

### Amnezia-style GUI wrapper

Download-and-deploy GUI for non-technical users. `meridian deploy` under the
hood; no terminal required.

### Key/credential rotation without reinstall

Rotate Reality keys, JWT secrets, and subscription paths in place.

## Good first issues

Contributor-friendly entry points (stable surfaces, clear scope, small
diffs). Some are already open as issues; the rest will be promoted as
contributors pick them up.

- Add Happ and ShadowRocket to the connection page's app list
- `meridian client disable/enable` CLI (panel API already supports it)
- Shell completion (typer built-in)
- Windows WSL setup guide (docs page)
- WebRTC leak warning on the connection page
- Replace `qrencode` binary with Python `segno` package
- iOS `apple-touch-icon` uses SVG — switch to PNG
