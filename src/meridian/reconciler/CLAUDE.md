# reconciler — Declarative plan / apply engine

Terraform-style reconciliation of `cluster.yml` desired state against actual
Remnawave panel state. Pure `compute_plan()` + `execute_plan()` executor.

## Design decisions

- **`compute_plan` is a pure function** — no I/O, no network, no side effects. Takes `(desired, actual, applied_*)` dataclasses, returns `Plan[PlanAction]`. Fully unit-testable; covers every diff case.
- **Typed `PlanAction.kind`** — `ADD_NODE / UPDATE_NODE / REMOVE_NODE / ADD_RELAY / UPDATE_RELAY / REMOVE_RELAY / ADD_CLIENT / REMOVE_CLIENT / ADD_SUBSCRIPTION_PAGE / REMOVE_SUBSCRIPTION_PAGE`. Executor dispatches by kind.
- **Applied-state snapshot** — `cluster._extra["desired_*_applied"]` recorded after every successful apply. Distinguishes intentional removal (in applied → from_extras=False → executes under `--yes`) from drift (not in applied → from_extras=True → requires `--prune-extras=yes`).
- **Parallel executor** — `ADD_NODE` actions run via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Per-worker `MeridianPanel` clone (`_make_worker_panel`); `threading.local()` event loop keeps async SDK calls isolated. Destructive kinds stay serial.
- **Plan ordering matches dependency** — adds run before removes; node removals run last (so relays referencing the node can be cleaned up first); `UPDATE_RELAY` is implemented as delete + recreate, so it's treated as destructive.

## What's done well

- **Drift-aware apply** — panel-side edits (admin adds a user in the UI) surface as plan actions on next `meridian plan`. Users see diffs; `--prune-extras` controls whether drift is pruned.
- **Failure-safety gate** — after any failure in a phase, subsequent destructive actions in the same plan are skipped. `cluster.yml` never gets rewritten to reflect a partial apply.
- **Rich terraform-style display** — `+` adds, `-` removes, `~` updates; `[drift]` marker on `from_extras=True`.

## Pitfalls

- **`from_extras=True` is drift, False is intentional.** Classification relies on the applied-state snapshot; don't skip it (`apply.py` must record after every success).
- **Hybrid imperative commands (`client add`, `node add`) must mirror into the applied snapshot** — otherwise the next plan re-classifies the fresh-imperative resource as drift. See `operations.py::_applied_snapshot_mirror_add`.
- **`compute_plan` takes `applied_*` as `set[str] | None`** — `None` means "no history, treat every actual-not-desired as drift". Preserve the None vs empty-set distinction.
- **Duplicate node names silently misroute** relay `exit_node` — the validator in `cluster.py` rejects duplicates at load time.
