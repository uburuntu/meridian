## Manual / External

Things that require human action outside the codebase.

### Housekeeping

- [ ] **Create 3-5 "good first issue" GitHub issues** — pull from P2 items below to signal contributor-friendliness
- [ ] **Regenerate OG image** — `og.png` shows old domain `getmeridian.com`; needs `getmeridian.org`
- [ ] **Retake connection page screenshot** — `connection-page.png` shows stale domain in browser bar
- [ ] **Set GitHub social preview** — repo Settings > Social preview (depends on new OG image)
- [ ] **Write VPS onboarding guide** — ~300-word doc page: Hetzner/DigitalOcean, Debian 12, SSH keys, IP retrieval

### Launch channels (priority order)

- [x] **Вастрик.Клуб** — [launched 2026-04-02](https://vas3k.club/project/31264/), 78 upvotes, 3k+ views, 100+ GitHub stars overnight
- [ ] **r/selfhosted post** (~350k) — lead with architecture diagram, terminal SVG, demo page. Be upfront about no web UI
- [ ] **Show HN** — "Deploy an undetectable VLESS+Reality proxy in one command". Discuss uTLS, HAProxy SNI, threat model
- [ ] **r/opensource post** (~335k) — mission framing: "help people in censored regions share secure internet"
- [ ] **Censorship expert TG channel post** — author of [state-of-usa-itd](https://habr.com/ru/articles/1014038/) offered to post about Meridian
- [ ] **Niche communities** — r/iran, Telegram V2Ray/Xray groups (Persian, Chinese), r/privacy (engage, don't self-promote)

### Post-launch

- [ ] **Technical blog post** — nginx+Xray architecture deep-dive. Cross-post to dev.to
- [ ] **"Meridian vs raw 3x-ui" comparison page** on website — captures search traffic
- [ ] **Respond to every comment** within 24h of launch posts

## P0 — Critical

### Anti-censorship

- [x] **Relay SNI mismatch** — relay deploy now scans its own IP range and picks a locally plausible SNI, independent of exit node. Fails closed when no relay-local SNI is available
- [ ] **Residual IP-cert fingerprinting path in IP mode** — keep tightening the direct-IP / no-SNI probe surface so the server does not hand out a distinctive nginx-served IP certificate response outside the intended camouflage path
- [x] **Fix XHTTP nginx path mismatch** — nginx now routes both `/<xhttp_path>` and `/<xhttp_path>/` to the XHTTP upstream, matching URL generation and Xray config

### Product

- [ ] **Client migration for rebuilds** — `meridian deploy NEW_IP --from OLD_IP` or equivalent so SNI, domain, clients, relays, and hosted handoff state can move without manual reconstruction
- [ ] **Eliminate state split-brain between local cache and server** — deploy now force-refreshes before provisioning; remaining work is to make branding writes, scanned-SNI writes, and deploy-time publish/sync paths fail closed so stale local `proxy.yml` never silently wins
- [ ] **Redeploy must update live state before publishing new handoff state** — never save or render URLs/pages/subscriptions that the live server is not yet serving
- [ ] **Partial panel recovery must preserve existing clients and relays** — recovery in `ConfigurePanel` still rebuilds only baseline state; it needs to reconstruct known clients, relay inbounds, and hosted pages from credentials before claiming success

### Security / Supply Chain

- [x] **Pin release artifacts to the CI-passed commit** — `release.yml` triggered by `workflow_run` now checks out `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha` for Pages, tags, and PyPI publishing
- [ ] **Replace mutable install/update trust chain with pinned, verified artifacts** — finish the release-artifact + checksum path for install/update flows
- [ ] **Stop executing unsigned remote scanner binaries as root** — pin and verify scanner artifacts, or vendor the scanner locally

---

## P1 — High

### Security

- [x] **SSH password auth not hardened during provisioning** — sshd hardening now uses an authoritative drop-in with `sshd -T` validation, overriding cloud-init
- [x] **Firewall cleanup deletes user's custom rules** — cleanup is now limited to Meridian-managed ports instead of deleting arbitrary user TCP rules
- [ ] **Remove public 3x-ui management from the shared 443 identity** — move the operator surface off the public camouflage identity or require an explicit operator-only access path

### Anti-censorship

- [ ] **Legacy relays need SNI backfill** — new relay deploys now fail closed without a relay-local SNI; remaining work is to repair legacy relay entries with blank `relay.sni` and regenerate affected hosted pages
- [ ] **Default SNI `www.microsoft.com` monitored** — make scanning the normal path, not the exceptional one
- [ ] **Make probe/check tooling mode-aware** — domain mode intentionally serves a real domain cert; verification must distinguish that from an IP-mode stealth leak

### Product

- [ ] **VPS provider guide** — first blocker for Tier 1 "tech friends"
- [ ] **Auto SSH key setup** — when VPS only has password auth, auto-generate key, copy via `ssh-copy-id`, and proceed. Eliminates manual key setup step before deploy
- [ ] **Telegram bot for client management** — add/revoke clients, view stats without SSH. Mobile-friendly for "not at computer" use case
- [x] **Post-deploy Cloudflare setup guidance** — domain-mode deploy now prints the DNS-only → proxied and SSL/WebSocket steps in CLI success output
- [ ] **Add Happ and ShadowRocket to connection page** — popular cross-platform clients, already support VLESS subscription URLs
- [ ] **Wizard hardening before SSH key validation** — can lock out password-only users
- [ ] **Connection page plain-language intro** — 2-3 trust-building sentences before "scan QR"
- [ ] **`client list` with usage stats** — last-seen, traffic totals via 3x-ui `getClientTraffics/{email}`
- [ ] **`client disable`/`client enable`** — panel API supports it, just needs CLI exposure
- [ ] **Proactive IP block detection** — server self-checks via ping endpoint, notifies via webhook/Telegram
- [ ] **Rebuild state transfer** — once `--from` exists, make the CLI explain what is being copied, what is live, and what still needs redeploy
- [ ] **Make destructive mutations transactional** — keep remote cleanup, local credential mutation, registry writes, and hosted page updates in one fail-closed transaction boundary
- [ ] **Require explicit server identity for risky commands** — enforce unique server aliases, separate deployer aliasing from recipient-facing branding, and add clearer target confirmation for destructive/stateful commands. Current implicit auto-select/local-mode behavior is too easy to mis-target
- [x] **Regenerate all hosted client pages when shared server state changes** — deploy/redeploy now also refreshes saved client pages after branding/domain/SNI changes
- [ ] **Unify deployer-facing and recipient-facing naming** — `--display-name` and `--server` currently model different identities but docs and UX blur them together. Either unify them or expose the distinction clearly in commands and docs
- [x] **Hosted connection page must stay self-hosted in recovery flows** — generated handoff pages no longer depend on `getmeridian.org/ping`; remaining work is to remove other third-party recovery/install dependencies from the critical path

### Reliability

- [ ] **WARP must be health-gated and reversible** — only switch outbound routing after WARP is actually up, and support full rollback
- [ ] **Domain mode must support safe steady-state redeploys behind orange-cloud** — redeploy should not require temporarily breaking the documented Cloudflare setup
- [x] **Persist relay SSH user across lifecycle commands** — `relay check` and `relay remove` now reuse the stored relay user by default
- [x] **Preserve forward-compatible nested credential fields** — `_extra` now preserves unknown nested fields under all credential sections on round-trip

### Testing

- [ ] **Make E2E fail on idempotency and redeploy regressions** — stop downgrading core deploy/redeploy failures to warnings
- [ ] **Add real-host coverage for production-sensitive branches** — cert issuance, nginx bootstrap, systemd, and redeploy migrations still need real-host coverage
- [ ] **Add end-to-end coverage for domain mode, WARP, relay migration, and recovery** — current mocks are not enough for deployment-changing behavior
- [ ] **Add dedicated tests for recovery and migration paths** — especially `ConfigurePanel` partial recovery, relay nginx migration for pre-existing servers, and stale-state conflict resolution

## P2 — Medium

### Security

- [ ] **`innerHTML` XSS surface** — risk if translations ever loaded externally

### Product

- [ ] **Batch client add** — `meridian client add alice bob charlie`
- [ ] **Per-client traffic/IP limits** — `--limit-gb`, `--limit-ip` flags
- [ ] **Self-hosted ping endpoint** — make this the default troubleshooting path from hosted client pages so connection testing still works when `getmeridian.org` is blocked and doesn't leak server metadata externally
- [ ] **Windows WSL setup guide** — doc page
- [ ] **`meridian server status`** — multi-server overview
- [ ] **`meridian test --via RELAY_IP`** — E2E test through relay
- [ ] **`meridian client export NAME`** — standalone HTML for offline sharing
- [ ] **OpenWRT router auto-deploy** — deploy client config directly to OpenWRT routers
- [ ] **Relay on server with existing nginx** — support deploying relay alongside an existing web server on port 443
- [ ] **WebRTC leak warning on connection page** — WebRTC leaks are client-side (browser discovers local IPs via OS APIs, bypassing the proxy entirely). Server-side fixes don't help — traffic never reaches Xray. Add amber warning box to connection page with: 1) link to browserleaks.com/webrtc leak test, 2) per-app guidance (v2rayNG: Global mode, Hiddify: route all connections), 3) browser extension recommendation. Same pattern as clock-sync warning
- [ ] **Replace `qrencode` binary with Python `segno` package** — eliminates system dependency

### Reliability

- [ ] **`_wait_for_panel` SSH vs panel confusion** — polling breaks on transient SSH issues
- [ ] **Xray process accumulation on `test_connection()` timeouts** — orphan processes not cleaned up when `_wait_for_port()` times out (`xray_client.py:305-350`)

### Testing

- [ ] **12 source modules have zero tests** — remaining gaps: `ping.py`, `check.py`, `scan.py`, `docker.py`, `config.py`, `display.py`, `ai.py`, `models.py`, `server.py`, `uninstall.py`, `provision/uninstall.py`

### UX

- [ ] **Multi-protocol jargon** — "XHTTP" meaningless to non-tech. Use "Connection 1 / 2"
- [ ] **`index.html` not in SW precache** — first offline visit fails
- [ ] **`apple-touch-icon` uses SVG** — iOS needs PNG
- [ ] **Wizard `_confirm_scan()` fails silently on WSL**
- [x] **Use canonical `subscription_url` in the PWA** — frontend now honors server-provided canonical URL instead of reconstructing from `location.pathname`

### Website

- [ ] **Live GitHub stars in trust bar** — shields.io badge or API fetch
- [ ] **Dark mode toggle** — system-preference only, no manual override
- [ ] **Docs sidebar on mobile** — no nav below 860px
- [ ] **Validate executable docs examples, not just flag tables** — CI currently misses broken README/deploy-guide commands and translated-doc drift. Add validation for high-traffic command examples and behavior claims across docs surfaces

---

## Icebox

- [ ] **Amnezia-style app deploy** — download app, enter VPS ip:user:password, auto-deploy without knowing SSH. Full GUI wrapper around `meridian deploy`
- [ ] **Meridian-branded cross-platform client app** — fork Hiddify (Flutter, sing-box, open source, 28k stars) into a stripped-down Meridian client. Subscription URL as primary flow: open app → paste URL / scan QR → connected. Happ is NOT open source (can't fork)
- [ ] **Key/credential rotation without reinstall**
- [ ] **Zero-to-VPN onboarding wizard on website**
- [ ] **Shell completion** — typer built-in
- [ ] **Remove v1→v2 credential migration** — dead code
- [ ] **Remove all Caddy and HAProxy code** — we use nginx, these are dead paths
- [ ] **Accessibility + i18n pass** — RTL CSS, ARIA landmarks, keyboard nav, touch targets, screen reader support, translation completeness (batched from ~20 items)
