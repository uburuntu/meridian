This guide covers every deployment option. If you're deploying for the first time, start with [Getting Started](/docs/en/getting-started/) — it walks through the basics in five minutes.

## Basic deployment

```
meridian deploy 1.2.3.4
```

The wizard guides you through configuration. Or specify everything upfront:

```
meridian deploy 1.2.3.4 --sni www.microsoft.com --client-name alice --yes
```

## All flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--sni HOST` | www.microsoft.com | TLS camouflage target |
| `--domain DOMAIN` | (none) | Cloudflare CDN fallback domain |
| `--client-name NAME` | default | Name for the first client |
| `--display-name NAME` | (none) | Label for connection pages (e.g. "Alice's VPN") |
| `--icon EMOJI_OR_URL` | (none) | Page icon — emoji or image URL |
| `--color PALETTE` | ocean | Page color theme (ocean/sunset/forest/lavender/rose/slate) |
| `--user USER` | root | SSH user (non-root gets sudo automatically) |
| `--harden / --no-harden` | enabled | Harden SSH + firewall (disable with `--no-harden` if other services share the server) |
| `--server NAME` | | Target server (name or IP) |
| `--yes` | | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--warp / --no-warp` | disabled | Route outgoing traffic through Cloudflare WARP |
| `--geo-block / --no-geo-block` | enabled | Block `.ru` domains and Russian IPs through the proxy |
| `--pq / --no-pq` | disabled | Post-quantum encryption — ML-KEM-768 hybrid (experimental) |

## Branding

Personalize connection pages so recipients know who set up their VPN:

```
meridian deploy 1.2.3.4 --display-name "Alice's VPN" --icon 🚀 --color sunset
```

- **`--display-name`** — appears in the trust bar and page title. Use your name or a friendly label.
- **`--icon`** — an emoji or image URL shown at the top of the connection page.
- **`--color`** — sets the accent color palette. Options: `ocean` (default), `sunset`, `forest`, `lavender`, `rose`, `slate`.

These settings are stored in server credentials and apply to all client connection pages.

## Choosing an SNI target

The SNI (Server Name Indication) target is the domain your server impersonates. This is **not** a domain you own — it's any popular website with TLS. When a censor probes your server, they see that real site's certificate, making your server indistinguishable from normal traffic.

The default (`www.microsoft.com`) works well for most cases. For optimal stealth, scan your server's network for same-ASN targets — these are harder to detect because the IP range matches:

```
meridian scan 1.2.3.4
```

**Good targets** (global CDN):
- `www.microsoft.com` — Azure CDN, global
- `www.twitch.tv` — Fastly CDN, global
- `dl.google.com` — Google CDN, global
- `github.com` — Fastly CDN, global

**Avoid** `apple.com` and `icloud.com` — Apple controls its own ASN ranges, making the IP/ASN mismatch instantly detectable.

### Camouflage target vs. domain

These are two different things:

- **Camouflage target** (`--sni`) — any popular website you **don't** own. Reality impersonates it so your traffic looks like normal HTTPS to that site. Censors probing see the real site's certificate.
- **Domain** (`--domain`) — a domain you **do** own, pointed to your server via Cloudflare. Adds a CDN fallback connection path. See [Domain mode](/docs/en/domain-mode/).

You can't use your own domain as a camouflage target — the certificate would match your server, not an unrelated site, which defeats the impersonation.

## Pre-flight check

Not sure if your server is compatible?

```
meridian preflight 1.2.3.4
```

Tests SNI target reachability, ASN match, port availability, DNS, OS compatibility, and disk space — without installing anything.

## Re-running deploy

It's safe to re-run `meridian deploy` at any time. The provisioner is fully idempotent:
- Credentials are loaded from cache, not regenerated
- Steps check existing state before acting
- No duplicate work

## Non-root deployment

```
meridian deploy 1.2.3.4 --user ubuntu
```

Non-root users get `sudo` automatically. The user must have passwordless sudo access.

## Local deployment

If you're running Meridian directly on the server (e.g. logged in via SSH as root):

```
meridian deploy local
```

This skips SSH entirely and runs all commands locally. The `local` keyword works with all commands:

```
meridian client add alice --server local
meridian preflight local
meridian scan local
```

Useful when SSH to self doesn't work (missing keys, firewall rules), for re-deploying on the same server, or in cloud-init startup scripts.

## Cloudflare WARP

WARP routes your server's outgoing traffic through Cloudflare's network. Destination websites see a Cloudflare IP address instead of your VPS IP.

```
meridian deploy 1.2.3.4 --warp
```

The interactive wizard also offers this option.

**When WARP helps:**
- Websites block your VPS provider's IP range (common with datacenter IPs on ChatGPT, Netflix, etc.)
- You want to hide the VPS IP from destination sites

**When you don't need WARP:**
- Normal browsing works fine through the proxy — most sites don't block VPS IPs
- You want maximum speed — WARP adds one extra hop (VPS → Cloudflare → destination)

**How it works technically:** Meridian installs the `cloudflare-warp` client on the server in SOCKS5 proxy mode (listening on `127.0.0.1:40000`). Xray uses this as its default outbound — all proxy egress goes through Cloudflare. Incoming connections (SSH, nginx, Xray inbound) are completely unaffected. WARP is free and doesn't require a Cloudflare account.

## Geo-blocking

By default, Meridian blocks `.ru` domains and Russian IP ranges through the proxy:

```bash
meridian deploy 1.2.3.4 --no-geo-block
```

This is intentional. It keeps Russian destinations off the proxy path, which reduces the chance of your VPS IP appearing in Russian-service logs and later getting blocked.

Leave it enabled if:
- Russian sites already work normally without the VPN
- You want the safer default for a shared server

Disable it if:
- You need `.ru` sites to open through Meridian
- You want all traffic to go through the VPN with no exceptions

The interactive wizard asks about this explicitly. The equivalent Xray rules are `geosite:category-ru` and `geoip:ru`.

## Adding a relay node

After deploying your exit server, add a relay node for resilience when the exit IP gets blocked. See the [Relay guide](/docs/en/relay/) for full setup instructions.

```bash
meridian relay deploy RELAY_IP --exit YOUR_EXIT_IP
```

## Management panel

Meridian deploys [Remnawave](https://remna.st/) as the management stack — a modern panel (backend) plus independent node service, both reverse-proxied by nginx at a random secret path. The panel UI lets you monitor traffic, view inbound configs, manage users and hosts, and check server status directly in a browser.

The panel URL and credentials are stored in your local `cluster.yml`:

```
cat ~/.meridian/cluster.yml
```

The `panel` section contains everything you need:

```yaml
panel:
  url: https://198.51.100.1/n7kx2m9qp4wj8vh3rf6tby5e/
  api_token: <JWT token>
  admin_user: admin
  admin_pass: <generated>
  secret_path: n7kx2m9qp4wj8vh3rf6tby5e
  sub_path: <subscription page path>
```

Open the `url` in your browser and log in with the admin credentials.

The panel path is randomized for security — treat it like a password. All `meridian` CLI commands use this same panel API under the hood, so anything you do via the CLI is also visible in the panel, and vice versa (drift is surfaced by `meridian plan`).

> **Note:** If you modify settings directly in the panel, they may be overwritten on the next `meridian deploy`.
