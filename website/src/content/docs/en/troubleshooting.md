## Which tool to use

```
BEFORE INSTALL           → meridian preflight IP
  "Will this server work for Meridian?"
  Tests: SNI reachability, port 443, DNS, OS, disk space.

AFTER INSTALL, CAN'T CONNECT → meridian test IP
  "Is the proxy reachable from where I am right now?"
  Tests: TCP port 443, TLS handshake (Reality), domain HTTPS.
  No SSH needed — runs from the client device.

AFTER INSTALL, SOMETHING BROKE → meridian doctor IP
  "Collect everything for debugging."
  Collects: server OS, Docker, Remnawave panel + node logs, ports, firewall, SNI, DNS.
```

Add `--ai` to preflight or doctor for an AI-ready diagnostic prompt.

## Can't connect at all

### Port 443 not reachable

**Causes:**
1. Cloud provider firewall / security group blocks port 443 inbound
2. ISP or network blocks the server IP entirely
3. Server is down or proxy is not running
4. UFW on the server doesn't allow port 443

**Fixes:**
1. Check cloud provider console — ensure port 443/TCP is allowed inbound
2. Try from a different network (mobile data, another Wi-Fi)
3. SSH in and check: `docker ps` (are `remnawave`, `remnawave-node`, `nginx` running?), `ss -tlnp sport = :443`
4. Check UFW: `ufw status` — should show 443/tcp ALLOW

### TLS handshake fails

**Causes:**
1. Xray is not running inside the Docker container
2. Port 443 is occupied by another service
3. Reality SNI target is unreachable from the server

**Fixes:**
1. Check Xray: `docker logs remnawave-node --tail 20`
2. Check port: `ss -tlnp sport = :443` — should be nginx
3. Test SNI: `meridian preflight IP`

### Domain not reachable

**Causes:**
1. DNS not pointing to server IP
2. nginx not running or failed to get TLS certificate
3. nginx not routing domain SNI correctly

**Fixes:**
1. Check DNS: `dig +short yourdomain.com @8.8.8.8`
2. Check nginx: `systemctl status nginx`
3. Check nginx config: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/meridian-stream.conf`

## Connection drops after seconds

**Causes:**
1. System clock skew >30 seconds between client and server
2. MTU issues on the network path
3. ISP resetting long-lived TLS sessions

**Fixes:**
1. Server: `timedatectl set-ntp true`. Client: enable automatic date/time
2. Try a different network
3. Use WSS/CDN connection (domain mode)

## Setup fails

### Port 443 conflict

Another service (Apache, Nginx) is using port 443. Stop it or use a clean server. `meridian preflight` will tell you what's using the port.

### Docker installation fails

Conflicting Docker packages from distro repos. Meridian auto-removes them, but if Docker is already running with containers, it skips to avoid disruption.

### SSH connection errors

Test SSH manually: `ssh root@SERVER_IP`. Ensure you have key-based access. Use `--user` flag if not root.

### Xray fails to start in the node container

Check the container: `docker logs remnawave-node --tail 50`. Common causes are a port collision on the host (node runs in `network_mode: host`, so ports from `cluster.yml` must be free), an unreachable panel (node registration needs the panel's `node_secret_key` at boot), or a missing `NET_ADMIN` capability.

**Fix:** `meridian teardown IP && meridian deploy IP` rebuilds the node cleanly. To verify Remnawave panel state, log into the admin UI at `https://<IP>/<secret_path>/` and check **Nodes** → the node should be `connected`; `meridian fleet status` surfaces the same information from the CLI.

### XHTTP inbound creation fails (port conflict)

Older Meridian versions (pre-v3.6.0) tried to put both Reality and XHTTP on port 443. v4 allocates deterministic per-node XHTTP/Reality/WSS ports (see [Architecture → Port assignments](/docs/en/architecture/#port-assignments)) and reverse-proxies through nginx, so the conflict cannot recur.

### Disk space insufficient

Less than 2GB free. Free up space: `docker system prune -af`, `journalctl --vacuum-time=1d`, check `/var/log/`.

### DNS resolution fails (domain mode)

Domain doesn't resolve to server IP yet. Update the DNS A record. Propagation is usually 5-15 minutes (up to 48 hours). Meridian warns if DNS doesn't resolve but lets you proceed.

## Was working, now stopped

**Most common cause:** Server IP got blocked. Run `meridian test IP` — if TCP fails, the IP is likely blocked.

See the [IP Blocked Recovery guide](/docs/en/recovery/) for step-by-step recovery options (new server, relay swap, CDN fallback).

Other causes:
- Server rebooted and Docker didn't auto-start → `docker start remnawave remnawave-node nginx` (or `cd /opt/remnawave && docker compose up -d`)
- Disk full → `df -h /`, `docker system prune -af`

## Slow speeds

1. Choose a server geographically closer (Finland, Netherlands, Sweden for Europe/Middle East)
2. Check server load: `htop` or `uptime`
3. Try WSS/CDN link — may have better routing through Cloudflare
4. Verify BBR is enabled: `sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control`

**Do NOT** run other protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard) on the same server — it flags the IP.

## Relay not working

See the [Relay guide — Troubleshooting](/docs/en/relay/#troubleshooting) section for relay-specific issues (port conflict, firewall, exit unreachable, service not started).

## Interpreting preflight output

| Check | What It Tests | If It Fails |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| SNI target reachability | Can the server reach the camouflage site? | Server's outbound is restricted. Try a different SNI with `--sni` |
| SNI ASN match | Does the SNI target share a CDN/ASN with the server? | Use a global CDN domain. Avoid apple.com (Apple-owned ASN) |
| Port 443 availability | Is port 443 free or used by Meridian? | Another service is on 443. Stop it or use a clean server |
| Port 443 external reachability | Can the outside world reach port 443? | Cloud firewall blocks it. Open port 443/TCP inbound |
| Domain DNS | Does the domain resolve to server IP? | Update DNS A record |
| Server OS | Is it Ubuntu/Debian? | Other distros may work but are untested |
| Disk space | At least 2GB free? | Free up space |

## Interpreting doctor output

| Section | What to Look For |
|---------|-----------------|
| Local Machine | OS compatibility |
| Server | OS version, uptime (recent reboot?), disk/memory usage |
| Docker | Are `remnawave`, `remnawave-node`, `nginx` containers running? Status should be "Up" |
| Remnawave Logs | Error messages from panel backend or node, "failed to start" entries, certificate issues |
| Listening Ports | Port 443 should show nginx. If missing, proxy isn't running |
| Firewall (UFW) | Port 443/tcp should be ALLOW. If not listed, it's blocked |
| SNI Target | Should show CONNECTED with a certificate chain |
| Domain DNS | Should resolve to server IP |

## Interpreting test output

| Check | Pass | Fail |
|-------|------|------|
| TCP port 443 | Server is network-reachable | Firewall, ISP block, or server down |
| TLS handshake | Reality protocol is working | Xray not running, port conflict, or SNI issue |
| Domain HTTPS | nginx working | DNS or nginx issue |

If all checks pass but the VPN client still can't connect: re-scan the QR code, check device clock is accurate (within 30 seconds), or try a different app (v2rayNG, Hiddify).
