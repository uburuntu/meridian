## Commands

### meridian deploy

Deploy proxy server to a VPS.

```
meridian deploy [IP] [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--sni HOST` | www.microsoft.com | TLS camouflage target |
| `--domain DOMAIN` | (none) | Cloudflare CDN fallback domain |
| `--client-name NAME` | default | Name for the first client |
| `--display-name NAME` | (none) | Label for connection pages |
| `--icon EMOJI_OR_URL` | (none) | Page icon — emoji or image URL |
| `--color PALETTE` | ocean | Page color theme (ocean/sunset/forest/lavender/rose/slate) |
| `--user USER` | root | SSH user |
| `--harden / --no-harden` | enabled | Harden SSH + firewall |
| `--pq / --no-pq` | disabled | Post-quantum encryption — ML-KEM-768 hybrid (experimental) |
| `--warp / --no-warp` | disabled | Route outgoing traffic through Cloudflare WARP |
| `--server NAME` | | Target server (name or IP) |
| `--decoy MODE` | none | Decoy response for unknown paths (`none` / `403`) |
| `--geo-block` / `--no-geo-block` | enabled | Block Russian domains and IPs (geosite:category-ru + geoip:ru) |
| `--ssh-port PORT` | 22 | SSH port (if non-standard) |
| `--yes` | | Skip confirmation prompts |

### meridian client

Manage client access keys and connection details.

```
meridian client add NAME [--server NAME]
meridian client show NAME [--server NAME]
meridian client list [--server NAME]
meridian client remove NAME [--server NAME] [--yes]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--yes`, `-y` | | Skip removal confirmation (applies to `client remove`) |

### meridian server

Manage known servers.

```
meridian server add [IP]
meridian server list
meridian server remove NAME
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--name NAME` | (auto) | Display name for the server |

### meridian relay

Manage relay nodes — lightweight TCP forwarders that route traffic through a domestic server to an exit server abroad.

```
meridian relay deploy RELAY_IP --exit EXIT [flags]
meridian relay list [--exit EXIT]
meridian relay remove RELAY_IP [--exit EXIT] [--yes]
meridian relay check RELAY_IP [--exit EXIT]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--exit/-e EXIT` | (required for deploy) | Exit server IP or name |
| `--name NAME` | (auto) | Friendly name for the relay (e.g., "ru-moscow") |
| `--port/-p PORT` | 443 | Listen port on relay server |
| `--user/-u USER` | root | SSH user on relay |
| `--ssh-port PORT` | 22 | SSH port on the relay server (if non-standard) |
| `--yes/-y` | | Skip confirmation prompts |

**How relays work**: Client connects to the relay's domestic IP. Relay forwards raw TCP to the exit server abroad. All encryption is end-to-end between client and exit — the relay never sees plaintext. All protocols (Reality, XHTTP, WSS) work through the relay.

### meridian plan

Show the reconciliation plan — what `meridian apply` would do to converge the cluster to the desired state declared in `cluster.yml`.

Reads `desired_nodes`, `desired_relays`, `desired_clients`, and `subscription_page` from `cluster.yml`, fetches actual state from the panel, and prints a Terraform-style diff with `+` for adds, `-` for removes, `~` for updates.

```
meridian plan
```

**Exit codes**:
- `0` — converged (no changes needed)
- `2` — changes pending (run `meridian apply` to converge)
- non-zero (1, 3) — error

See [Declarative workflow](/docs/en/getting-started/#declarative-workflow) for how to compose `cluster.yml`.

### meridian apply

Converge the cluster to the desired state declared in `cluster.yml`. Runs `plan` internally, shows the diff, asks for confirmation, then executes the actions in dependency order (removals first, then adds, then removals of nodes last).

```
meridian apply [--yes] [--prune-extras=ask|yes|no]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--yes`, `-y` | | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--prune-extras` | `ask` | How to handle drift — resources present on the panel but missing from `cluster.yml`. `ask` prompts per-resource (downgraded to `no` under `--yes` for safety); `yes` auto-removes; `no` skips and prints a one-line summary |

Destructive actions (removals, UPDATE_RELAY re-provisioning) print a warning and require a separate confirmation. A failure early in the plan skips remaining destructive actions — `cluster.yml` stays truthful.

**Drift handling example:** if `cluster.yml` lists `desired_clients: ['alice']` but the panel also has `bob` (e.g. created via the panel UI), `meridian plan` shows `- remove client: bob`. With default `--prune-extras=ask` you'll be asked whether to remove `bob` or keep him. `--yes --prune-extras=yes` runs the removal silently; `--yes` alone (no explicit `--prune-extras`) skips it.

### meridian preflight

Pre-flight server validation. Tests SNI, ports, DNS, OS, disk, ASN without installing anything.

```
meridian preflight [IP] [--ai] [--server NAME]
```

### meridian scan

Find optimal SNI targets on the server's network using RealiTLScanner.

```
meridian scan [IP] [--server NAME]
```

### meridian test

Test proxy reachability and verify actual connections from the client device. No SSH needed.

First checks basic reachability (TCP, TLS handshake, domain HTTPS). Then downloads a local xray client binary (cached after first use), connects through the proxy for each active protocol (Reality, XHTTP, WSS), and confirms traffic flows end-to-end.

```
meridian test [IP] [--server NAME]
```

### meridian probe

Probe a server as a censor would — check if the deployment is detectable. No SSH needed. Works on any server, not just Meridian deployments. Accepts IP addresses or domain names.

Runs 9 checks: port surface, HTTP response, TLS certificate, SNI consistency, proxy path probing, WebSocket upgrade, reverse DNS, HTTP/2 support, and legacy TLS versions.

```
meridian probe [IP|DOMAIN] [--server NAME]
```

### meridian doctor

Collect system diagnostics for debugging. Alias: `meridian rage`.

```
meridian doctor [IP] [--ai] [--server NAME]
```

### meridian teardown

Remove proxy from server.

```
meridian teardown [IP] [--server NAME] [--yes]
```

### meridian update

Update CLI to latest version.

```
meridian update
```

### meridian --version

Show CLI version.

```
meridian --version
meridian -v
```

## Global flags

These flags are available on most commands that interact with a server:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--server NAME` | Target a specific named server |
| `--user/-u USER` | SSH user (default: root, non-root gets sudo automatically) |
| `--sni HOST` | TLS camouflage target (used by deploy, preflight, test, doctor) |
| `--domain DOMAIN` | Cloudflare CDN fallback domain (used by deploy, preflight, test) |

## Server resolution

Commands that need a server follow this priority:
1. Explicit IP argument or `local` keyword (deploy on this server without SSH)
2. `--server NAME` flag (also accepts `--server local`)
3. Local mode detection (running on the server itself)
4. Single server auto-select (if only one saved)
5. Interactive prompt
