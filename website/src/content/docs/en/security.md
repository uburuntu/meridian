## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Meridian:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue**
2. Email the maintainer or use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/uburuntu/meridian/security/advisories/new)
3. Include steps to reproduce and potential impact

We aim to respond within 48 hours and will credit reporters in the fix.

## Security design

- **Credentials**: stored with `0600` permissions in `~/.meridian/cluster.yml`, secrets never passed through shell commands without `shlex.quote()`, redacted from `meridian doctor` output. Directory permissions are `0700` (owner-only). Any application running as your user can read these files — this is inherent to all CLI tools that store credentials locally (SSH keys, cloud CLI tokens, etc.). If your local machine is compromised at the user level, credential encryption would not help: malware can keylog the passphrase or intercept SSH sessions. Protect your local machine.
- **Panel access**: Remnawave admin UI reverse-proxied by nginx at a secret HTTPS path in all modes — no SSH tunnel required. URL and admin credentials are in the `panel` section of `~/.meridian/cluster.yml`
- **SSH**: password authentication disabled by default; fail2ban enabled for brute-force protection
- **Firewall**: UFW configured with deny-all-incoming, only ports 22, 80, and 443 opened
- **Docker images**: Remnawave backend, node, and subscription page are pinned to tested versions in `src/meridian/config.py`
- **TLS**: [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) handles certificates via Let's Encrypt, served by nginx

## Scope

Meridian configures proxy servers — it does **not** implement cryptographic protocols. The underlying security depends on:

- [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) — VLESS+Reality protocol
- [Remnawave](https://remna.st/) — panel + node management stack
- [nginx](https://nginx.org/) — SNI routing and TLS termination
